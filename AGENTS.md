# Agent notes

This repository's high-level rules live in `README.md` under "Project guidelines".

Agent-specific notes:
- Prefer updating XML docs whenever you touch public API surfaces.
- Keep changes scoped to a single concern and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Preserve provider-specific behavior boundaries (Core vs provider projects).
